# Wordify

Wordify is a word-search web application built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.
The project is developed using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, focusing on clean UI, responsiveness, and smooth user experience.

This app allows users to quickly look up word definitions, pronunciations, examples, and more—presented in a simple, intuitive interface.
